Downloading a Text File
Web pages are text files and are easy to download. For 
example, to save the file that you are reading right now, 
click "File--Save As" on your browser's toolbar, and save the 
file on your hard drive or floppy disk, either as a plain text 
(.TXT) or HyperText Markup Language (.HTM or .HTML) file. You 
should be able to open such files in your word processor or 
browser.
Since saving an HTML file as a simple text file strips out all 
the hypertext code, note that the saved file will require some 
editing in your word processor. It may have odd line lengths 
and other odd format features. Open it in your word processor 
to edit it.
Internet information providers often make word-processed files 
more immediately accessible by providing simple text files 
(usually with a "TXT" file extension). Text files are simple, 
universal, and transportable, but unfortunately they cannot 
convey attributes (such as underlining or bold). Here, for 
example, is a text file of the page you are reading. Try 
saving it and opening it in your word processor. This time the 
simple text file will look much better, because I've 
edited it for you beforehand.
